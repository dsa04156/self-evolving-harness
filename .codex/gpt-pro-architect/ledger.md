Every future row must record the actual packet hash, transport time, external thread identifier, raw
response path, interpreted decision, required revisions, and the commit containing those revisions.

## Invalid collision — 2026-07-30

- sent: packet 1 was accidentally directed to an existing unrelated EdgeX/KubeEdge architect tab
- transport: Oracle CLI direct remote Chrome
- conversation url: `https://chatgpt.com/c/6a66f5cc-77f4-83ee-a07c-869fcea72289`
- architect output: `.codex/gpt-pro-architect/responses/response-0-invalid-topic-collision.md`
- response hash: `77e82ebb86ecaff63be7ef11935d6fac5f7a4086a37cc84010c0eaed2bccacf6`
- disposition: invalid; never usable as evidence or approval
- correction: stopped follow-ups, created a new project-specific tab, and reran the packet

## Round 1 — 2026-07-30

- sent: `.codex/gpt-pro-architect/packets/packet-1.md`
- transport: Oracle CLI 0.16.1, browser engine, `gpt-5-pro`
- topic id: `self-evolving-harness-architecture`
- conversation url: `https://chatgpt.com/c/6a6b1847-22c8-83e8-9558-8297a43979e0`
- oracle session: `self-evolving-harness-gate1-fresh`
- archive policy: never
- continuation: same exact conversation required
- browser endpoint: `127.0.0.1:9222`
- browser tab ref: `4BA3B4F29D8FD1597A712A46C80CB67E`
- reuse preflight: direct remote dry-run confirmed exact target reuse and no Chrome launch
- new window opened: no; one new project tab
- model evidence: requested `gpt-5-pro`; live harvest reported visible `Pro`
- architect decision: `REVISE`
- accepted actions: revise design contracts, schemas, split/budget/statistical rules, principal matrix,
  fixture spec, ADR, validator/adversarial acceptance criteria, and quarantine the Python spike
- rejected actions: runtime/evolution implementation, provider/benchmark runs, gate/test access, canary,
  promotion, and performance/security claims before revised Gate 1 approval
- user decision: blanket authorization remains subject to preregistered gates
- next: produce packet 1R in the same conversation

## Round 1R preparation — 2026-07-30

- packet: `.codex/gpt-pro-architect/packets/packet-1r.md`
- authoritative project copy: `architect/PACKET_01R_RESEARCH_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- packet hash: `877981e4f07254c8048ecaf63e4757b1670c5d0bb2c9cc33414bdc21e08fe242`
- manifest: `architect/PACKET_01R_MANIFEST.json`
- local precheck: `PASS schemas=29 type_registry=valid splits=28/14/14/14+45/10/34 spike=quarantined markdown_links=10`
- authorized transport: same exact project conversation and browser target only
- status: prepared, not yet transmitted
